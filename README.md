## CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

Welcome to my repository! This space contains all the programs and projects I have completed as part of Harvard's **CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python** course. Each folder and file here represents my progress, learning, and understanding of the course material.

## About the Course
CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python is an entry-level course designed to teach fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving techniques using Python language. Topics covered include:

- Basic syntax and semantics of Python
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions
- File I/O
- Data structures
- Regular expressions
- Object-oriented programming
- Libraries and APIs

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```
📂 root-directory
├── 📁 Week1
│   ├── hello.py
│   ├── calculator.py
│   └── ...
├── 📁 Week2
│   ├── mario.py
│   ├── cash.py
│   └── ...
...
```

Each folder corresponds to a week/module of the course, and the files inside represent individual practice programs, assignments, exercises, or projects.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the code in this repository. To run any Python file:

1. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.9 or later).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajaygangwar245/CS50Python.git
   cd CS50Python
   ```

3. Navigate to the file's directory and execute it:

   ```bash
   cd foldername
   python filename.py
   ```

## Projects and Highlights of course
Some of the key projects and assignments include:

- **Problem Set Solutions**: Practical problem-solving exercises for each week.
- **Final Project**: A capstone project that demonstrates the application of concepts learned throughout the course.

## Feedback and Contributions
I am continually learning and improving. If you have suggestions or find ways to optimize my code, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Collaboration is always welcome!
